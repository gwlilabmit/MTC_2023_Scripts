# CDS files

Here is the collection of CDS (Coding Sequence) files that were used in the course of this analysis.

There are just three files here - B. subtilus (BS 168 NCBI record: NC_000964.3), E coli (MG1655, NCBI record: NC-00913.2) and one made for the plasmid indicating the plasmid gene location.

For each of the records there also exists a "processed" version, which simply converts the original CDS file into a version more usable for downstream analysis.
