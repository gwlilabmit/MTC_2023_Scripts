[A ] In order to test the fidelity of our captured snapshot over time we collect an early sample of the lysate and the capsules then subject the cells to an ethanol stress, after which we collect a late sample of the lysate and capsules. [B] The transcript vs  transcript abundances between the early and late lysate samples. [C] The transcript vs  transcript abundances between the early and late capsule samples. [D] - The log-distribution of early/late capsule transcript abundances for both the lysate and the capsule samples.  The Capsule distribution is much tighter around 0 than the lysate samples.
