[A]To test the possibility of cross-transcript contamination of the snapshots during the snapshot removal process we mixed the capsule-containing E. coli cells with wild-type B. subtilis cells, and then purified capsules from both the mixed sample and the original capsule containing sample, in addition to collecting reads from the total lysate of the E. coli sample, the B. sub sample and the Mixed samples.  Reads were then sequenced and reads were maintained which uniquely mapped to either the B.sub or E. coli genome. [B] The read vs read agreement of transcripts purified from the heterogeneous sample, and from the E. coli sample.  The most abundant reads (LacI, and the capsules themselves) were emitted from this plot to better see agreement of other transcripts.  A linear fit of the samples has an R^2 value of …… [C] Mapping of each of the 5 samples as a function of the % of their reads uniquely mapping to B. sub vs E. coli. The Two capsule samples are both at > 99.8% reads mapping uniquely to the E. coli genome, while the mixed lysate sample only have ___ % of reads mapping uniquely to the E. coli genome.
