# dataframe files

### What you will find here:

- dataframe files.  These files take the data in each wig files and compare it to a CDS file to generate the number of reads found in each coding body sequence for each gene. They are written as simple tab deliminated text files with the gene name, read count, and several pieces of information about each gene.  We like to read in this file and work with it using pandas.
