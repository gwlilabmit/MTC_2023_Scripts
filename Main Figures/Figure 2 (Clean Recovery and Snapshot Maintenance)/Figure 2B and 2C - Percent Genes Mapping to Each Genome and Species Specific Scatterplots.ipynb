    "### Figure 2B - Comparison of Genes mapping to E. coli and B. sub for MTC encapsulated transcripts and Lysate:\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we will look at the encapsulated transcripts versus general lysate transcripts for an experiment where MTC-containing E. coli were mixed ~ 50:50 with non-MTC-containing B. sub.  If the MTCs are effective at protecting encapsulated transcripts from contaimination from general RNAs in the surrounding lysate then the encapsulated transcript sample should be map entirely to the E. coli genome. \n",
    "\n",
    "Note - for all these transcripts, we have discarded all reads which do not uniquely map to either the E. coli genome or the B. sub genome. (this was done at the alignment step - please check out the raw data processing scripts for this experiment to see more!)\n",
    "\n",
    "Note - this notebook makes use of bokeh's export svg functionality to create svgs of each image to inlcude in Adobe illustrator.  However each figure is also generated as a preview in Jupyter notebook.  Simply don't run cells that save the image to svg if this is an issue for you and you should still be able to preview the interactive figures. "
