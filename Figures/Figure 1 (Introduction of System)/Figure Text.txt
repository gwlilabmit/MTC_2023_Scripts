[A] The structure of the self-assembling protein structure which serves as the Molecular Time Capsules, or MTCs.  This construct was developed by Butterfield et. al, and demonstrated a capacity to capture unbiased recordings of the transcriptome. [B] The structure of the plasmid used to induce the MTCs.  The system is IPTG inducible, and can also be shut off by filter-washing cells and resuspending in IPTG-free media. [C] Theoretical illustration of what the capsule production curve might look like as a function of time, and of presence of IPTG. The capsules which constitute the snapshot are under the curve. [D]. Illustration of how cells containing capsules are processed to recover RNA for sequencing of the captured transcriptomes.
